# frequency-analysis-encryption
In this project, you could take text that is encrypted in any Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher for example:  
1) Caesar cipher  
2) Sliding cipher  
3) Substitution cipher  
4) Transposition ciphers  
5) exe 

Paste the Encrypted text in the text box, and press the "convert" button.  
If the text does not come out so clear, you could use some common sence and change some letters around.  
You could also edit the result to help you read the result.
If you dont put in eny text, it will automatically use a file and decrypt it.
The file letters are by the frequency of the average letters in English.  
The complexity of algorithm, when N is the amount of letters, and R is the amount of letters in the language is: O(N+R^2+NR),  
because the amount of letters in most languages is not that big, so the complexity of algorithm will be: O(NR).  
Hope you enjoy using my program.
